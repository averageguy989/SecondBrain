-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your environment variables.
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
    ACCESS_SECRET="development"
    REFRESH_SECRET="webdevelopment"
    NODE_ENV = "development"
    PORT=5000
    ```
    - Initialize the Prisma database:
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```
    - Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the backend API URL.
    ```env
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth
    ```
    *(Note: If you are not using Vite, you may need to name the variable `REACT_APP_API_URL`)*

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

To run the application, you'll need to start both the backend and frontend servers in separate terminal windows.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    - Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend development server will start, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is in use).
